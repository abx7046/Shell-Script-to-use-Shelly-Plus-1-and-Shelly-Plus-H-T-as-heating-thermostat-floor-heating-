# ShellyPlusSwitch

Simple script to use a shelly plus 1 or so as a switch (actuator).
What is needed to run this:

Shelly Plus H&T
Shelly Plus 1 (or Plus 2)
OpenWeather account (a free one).

This script does control a Shelly switch to switch on / off an actuator.

The external temperature is used to activate the heating or not.
The internal temperature is used to switch the actuator either on or off.
The trigger for the internal does haver a simpliefed approach to allow to adjust the temperature threshold depending on the time of the day.
Timezone / summertime should be adj. as well.
